    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
      Try these slow cooker meatballs for a tasty family meal. Turkey mince
      makes lighter meatballs which kids love. They also freeze well so you can
      batch cook.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tbsp rapeseed oil</li>
      <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 carrots, finely diced</li>
      <li>2 celery sticks, finely diced</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>500g carton tomato passata</li>
      <li>2 tbsp chopped parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the meatballs</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>400g lean mince turkey</li>
      <li>4 tbsp porridge oats</li>
      <li>pinch paprika</li>
      <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
      <li>spray of oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the slow cooker if necessary. Heat the oil in a non-stick frying
        pan and add the onion, carrots, celery and garlic and fry gently for a
        minute. Pour in the passata, add the parsley and stir, then transfer the
        lot to the slow cooker.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the meatballs, tip the mince into a large bowl. Add the oats,
        paprika, garlic and plenty of black pepper, and mix everything together
        with your hands. Divide the mixture into 20 lumps about the size of a
        walnut and roll each piece into a meatball. Spray or run a non-stick pan
        with a little oil and gently cook the meatballs until they start to
        brown. Add them to the tomato base and cook on Low for 5 hours. Serve
        over rice or pasta if you like, or with a green salad.
