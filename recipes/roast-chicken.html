    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
      What more can we say? A classic roast chicken recipe should be in
      everyone's repertoire, and it can always save the day.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 onion, roughly chopped</li>
      <li>2 carrots, roughly chopped</li>
      <li>1 free range chicken, about 1.5kg/3lb 5oz</li>
      <li>1 lemon, halved</li>
      <li>small bunch thyme (optional)</li>
      <li>25g butter, softened</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the gravy</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tbsp plain flour</li>
      <li>250ml chicken stock (a cube is fine)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Have a shelf ready in the middle of
        the oven without any shelves above it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scatter 1 roughly chopped onion and 2 roughly chopped carrots over the
        base of a roasting tin that fits the whole 1 ½ kg chicken, but doesn’t
        swamp it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the cavity of the chicken liberally with salt and pepper, then
        stuff with 2 lemon halves and a small bunch of thyme, if using.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sit the chicken on the vegetables, smother the breast and legs all over
        with 25g softened butter, then season the outside with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place in the oven and leave, undisturbed, for 1 hr 20 mins – this will
        give you a perfectly roasted chicken. To check, pierce the thigh with a
        skewer and the juices should run clear.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully remove the tin from the oven and, using a pair of tongs, lift
        the chicken to a dish or board to rest for 15-20 mins. As you lift the
        dish, let any juices from the chicken pour out of the cavity into the
        roasting tin.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the chicken is resting, make the gravy. Place the roasting tin
        over a low flame, then stir in 1 tbsp flour and sizzle until you have a
        light brown, sandy paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually pour in 250ml chicken stock, stirring all the time, until you
        have a thickened sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simmer for 2 mins, using a wooden spoon to stir, scraping any sticky
        bits from the tin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain the gravy into a small saucepan, then simmer and season to taste.
        When you carve the bird, add any extra juices to the gravy.
      </li>
    </ol>
